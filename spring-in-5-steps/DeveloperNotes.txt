________________Spring Level 1 - First 10 Steps in Spring_______________

What is Spring?
***[Spring is a Dependency Injection Framework]
Software needs (depends) on other software

What is Dependency Injection?

What is a Dependency?
E.g.: Business Layer is a DEPENCY of the Web Layer
E.g.: Data Layer is a DEPENCY of the Business Layer
E.g.: Member Methods are DEPENCIES of a Class

Tight Coupling is BAD
Loose Coupling is GOOD

Creating Objects and Populating Dependencies - Spring Framework

It my job as a developer to tell Spring Framework:
- What are the Objects you need to manage, and
- What are the Dependencies of each Class

@Component   // Spring you need to manage instances of ComplexBusinessService
public class ComplexBusinessService {
	SortAlgorithm sort

@Component   // Spring you need to manage instances of BubbleSortAlgorithm
public class ComplexBusinessService implement SortAlgorithm {

But how do you tell (inform Spring) that SortAlogrithm is a Dependecy of ComplexBusinessService?
@Component   // Spring you need to manage instances of ComplexBusinessService
public class ComplexBusinessService {
	@Autowired
	SortAlgorithm sort

@Autowired - Spring starts looking for this Dependecy

Beans - Object instances that Spring manages are called Beans.
Autowiring - The process were Spring identifies the dependencies, finds matches for the dependencies and populates them
Inversion of Control - Taking the control of the tightly couple dependency of a class and giving its control to Spring 
IOC Container - General terminology for anything that is implementing IOC
Application Context - The most important IOC Container is the Spring Framework


************************* Creating a project through Spring Initializr ****************************
Spring Initializr - https://start.spring.io/
Course a Spring Boot version 2.0+ ~= Spring 5  //GPC: I think
// avoid SNAPSHOT versions

You know how to fill out a Spring Initializr page, which drops a zip file to where you want:

// 8.Step3: Making BinarySearch Losely Coupled
SortAlgorithm is a Dependecy of the BinarySearch
BinarySearch depends of SortAlgorithm

* Most important concepts behind Spring in Dependency Injection and Loose Coupling
// 9.Step4: Using Spring Framework to Manage Dependencies
Your need to tell Spring about to wire beans together:
1. What are the beans that Spring has to manage? BinarySearchImpl, BubbleSortAlgo
2. What are the dependencies of a bean? BinarySearchImpl->SortAlgorithm
3. Where to search for beans? (Component Scan) => No need, all of our code is in the same package
ApplicaitonContext - manages all the beans

// 10.Step5: What is happening in the background?
src/main/resources/application.properties: //add following line
logging.level.org.springframework = debug;
* studied the logging for bean identification and autowiring of dependencies

// 11.Step6: Dynamic auto wiring and Troubleshooting - @Primary
Both classes implement SortAlgorithm which cause a problem, making BubbleSortAlgorithm the @Primary solves this
@Component
@Primary
public class BubbleSortAlgorithm implements SortAlgorithm {
@Component
public class QuickSortAlgorithm implements SortAlgorithm{

// 13.Step7: Constructor and Setter Injection
In our code neither a Constructor or Setter is needed for Injection;
@Autowired
private SortAlgorithm sortAlgorithm;
// This alone will automatically search for a SortAlgorithm through the tree of dependencies

________________Spring Level 2 - Spring in depth_________________
// 18.Step11: Dependency Injection - a few more examples
Happy Horseshit - blah, blah, blah, already covered

// 19.Step12: Autowiring in Depth - by Name and @Primary
@Primary has presedence over Named
Happy Horseshit - blah, blah, blah, already covered

// 20.Step13 - Autowiring in Depth - @Qualifier annotation
So for competing dependencies we have 3 options: @Qualifier("name"), @Primary, Named

// 21.Step14 - Scope of a Bean - Prototype and Singleton
- Default: singleton - One instance per Spring Context
- prototype - New bean whenever requested
- request - One bean per HTTP request
- session - One bean per HTTP session

// 22. Step15 - Complex scenarios with Scope of a Spring Bean - Mix of Prototype and Singleton
Use proxy to get a new instance of the Depency

// 23. Step 15B - Difference Between Spring Singleton and GOF(Gang Of Four) Singleton
Happy Horseshit - blah, blah, blah

// 24. Step 16 - Using Component Scan to scan for beans
@SpringBootApplication  //Automatically does a Component Scan the main class package and subpackages

But, if your components are elsewhere, then:
package com.jerryc.spring.basics.springin5steps; // Default package to scan
@SpringBootApplication
@ComponentScan("com.jerryc.spring.basics.componentscan") // tell the application to package scan  here
public class SpringIn5StepsComponentscanApplication {

Think of @ComponentScan like a search for compenents
************* BAD: Instructor is cluster flocking multiple sub-projects with one project ***********


// 25. Step 17 - Lifecycle of a Bean - @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy
The life cycle of a bean is controlled by: **"the Spring IOC Container"**
After the bean is created and initialized with its dependencies, then the @PostConstruct Method is called.
@PostConstruct
public void postConstructInit() {
	logger.info("postConstructInit- do further initialization of the BinarySearchImpl bean");
}
@PreDestroy
public void preDestroyStuff() {
	logger.info("preDestroyStuff- do further cleanup before the BinarySearchImpl bean is removed from IOC Container");
}
//NOTE: did not see preDestroyStuff corresponding log entry???


// 26. Step 18 - Container and Dependency Injection (CDI) - @Named, @Inject
CDI is a standard names the annoations and functionality of the **"the Spring IOC Container"**
CDI is an interface that defines how to do Depency Injection
Alike a Standard for JPA(Defines the interface) and Hibernate(Understands JPA IPA and implements it).
Why in the flying Flock are there psuode equilant tags from the CDI.
Why didn't Spring just do what the Standard stated. WTF:GPC
CDI Standard:
@Inject, Spring uses @Autowired
@Named, Spring uses @Component, @Qualifier
@Singleton, Spring defines a scope Singleton

What is this Cluster Flock? (GPC: I think I'm in a nightmare)
Instructor: CDI showed a new way of doing the above (GPC:WTF)
So you can use the Spring annotations OR the CDI anotations, Which One?
CDI: 51% vote because its the standard, Spring Implementation: 49% because its the implemation
What kind of sick dev world has these different ~= equal annotations (GPC:WTF)
This course will continue with Spring Annotations. (I guess this was a heads-up)
I have NEVER seen a standard that says @ABC is the annotation; but, the implentation was @XYZ (GPC:WTF)

// 28. Step 19 - Removing Spring Boot in Basic Spring Core Application
/*As we start removing Spring Boot and bringing in Spring core in the next step, you would see
A few SLF4J errors.
Logging does not work
Do not worry about them. We will fix them in Step 20.*/
- In pom.xml commented out:
<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
- Added
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-core</artifactId>
		</dependency>
		
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-context</artifactId>

		</dependency>
		
		<dependency>
			<groupId>ch.qos.logback</groupId>
			<artifactId>logback-classic</artifactId>
		</dependency>
- Updated SpringIn5StepsBasicApplication.java from Spring Boot to Spring Core (See Code)
Exercise: Migrate the other inbedded applications (GPC:WTF, and loose want I learned, WTF)


// 29. Step 20 - Fixing minor stuff - Add Logback and Close Application Context
Yep,(I only updated SpringIn5StepsBasicApplication.java), (GPC:FYI:JunkInTheTrunk)


// 30. Step 21 - Defining Spring Application Context using XML - Part 1
****Before Spring 2.5 Beans and Dependencies HAD do be defined in an xml file.
      In retrospect, very bad as compared to Annotations****
Created resources/applicaitonContext.xml <--------<<<
We need to define a NAMESPACE 
Google: spring documation applcation context example
https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html
3.2.1 Configuration metadata
The following example shows the basic structure of XML-based configuration metadata:
Copied content to resources/applicaitonContext.xml: ***We will define the beans and there dependencies***
[Code:XmlJdbcConnection -> copy qualified name -> applicaitonContext.xml: class="here"]
 BEFORE: <bean id="..." class="...">
 AFTER:
 <bean id="xmlJdbcConnection" class="com.jerryc.spring.basics.springin5steps.xml.XmlJdbcConnection">


// 31. Step 22 - Defining Spring Application Context using XML - Part 2
resources/applicaitonContext.xml:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.0.xsd">

  <bean id="xmlJdbcConnection"
  	class="com.jerryc.spring.basics.springin5steps.xml.XmlJdbcConnection">
  </bean>

  <!-- xmlPersonDAO DEPENDS on xmlJdbcConnection == @Autowired -->
  <bean id="xmlPersonDAO"
  	class="com.jerryc.spring.basics.springin5steps.xml.XmlPersonDAO">
  	<property name="xmlJdbcConnection" ref="xmlJdbcConnection"/>
  </bean>
  
</beans>

Also,
XmlJdbcConnection.java and XmlPersonDAO.java stripped of ALL Annotations
SpringIn5StepsXMLContextApplication.java
:
public static void main(String[] args) {
	
		try (ClassPathXmlApplicationContext applicationContext =
			new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("applicationContext.xml")) {
:


// 32. Step 23 - Mixing XML Context with Component Scan for Beans defined with Annotations
- ApplicationContext.xml(added) <context:component-scan base-package="com.jerryc.spring.basics"/>
- SpringIn5StepsXMLContextApplication.java
LOGGER.info("Beans Loaded -> {}", (Object) applicationContext.getBeanDefinitionNames());
Log:
Beans Loaded -> [componentDAO, scopedTarget.componentJdbcConnection, componentJdbcConnection, 
springIn5StepsBasicApplication, binarySearchImpl, bubbleSortAlgorithm, quickSortAlgorithm,
someCdiBusiness, someCdiDao, scopedTarget.jdbcConnection, jdbcConnection, personDAO,
org.springframework.context.annotation.internalConfigurationAnnotationProcessor, 
org.springframework.context.annotation.internalAutowiredAnnotationProcessor, 
org.springframework.context.annotation.internalCommonAnnotationProcessor, 
org.springframework.context.event.internalEventListenerProcessor, 
org.springframework.context.event.internalEventListenerFactory, xmlJdbcConnection, xmlPersonDAO]


// 33. Step 24 - IOC Container vs Application Context vs Bean Factory
IOC - shifting tightly-coupled to loosely-coupled components 
IOC Container - Concept responsible for Identifying, Injecting and Managing the IOC Components, Dependencies, etc.
In Spring there are 2 implementation of the IOC Container.
1. Applicaiton Context - We have been only been using Applicaiton Context
   (Spring recommended 99% of the time, except when memory is a premium)
   Applicaiton Context - Bean Factory++ for full full EE Applications
2. Bean Factory - basic wiring of spring-core Components. It is a subset of Application Context


// 34. Step 25 - @Component vs @Service vs @Repository vs @Controller
What is the difference between them and when to use what
@Component - If you are not sure which one to use, then go with @Component until deemed otherwise
@Controller - Used in Spring MVC, used to define a Controller in the Web(UI) Layer
- Makes sure the Model is populated and the correct View is rendered
@Service - Used at the Business Layer, 
@Repository - Used at the Data Layer,
E.G.s:
com.jerryc.spring.basics.springin5steps.scope.PersonDAO.java
@Repository
public class PersonDAO {	
	@Autowired
	JdbcConnection jdbcConneciton;
-----
com.jerryc.spring.basics.springin5steps.basic.BinarySearchImpl.java
@Service
@Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)
public class BinarySearchImpl {
	private Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(this.getClass());	
	@Autowired
	@Qualifier("quick")
	private SortAlgorithm sortAlgorithm;
-----
com.jerryc.spring.basics.springin5steps.basic.BubbleSortAlgorithm.java & QuickSortAlgorithm.java
@Service
@Qualifier("bubble")
public class BubbleSortAlgorithm implements SortAlgorithm {
-----
***** If there is NO change in functionality, then why use a specific Annotation? *****
AOP - You can identify the annotation and add functionality (talk more about this in AOP section)
Allows you to classify you Components into different Categories
Spring has a different Exception functionality for different Annotations
You want to log everything in your Business Layer, then you can track @Service component logic


// 35. Step 26 - Read values from external properties file
resource/app.properties:
external.service.url=http://someserver.dev.com/service

com.jerryc.spring.basics.springin5steps.properties.SomeExternalService.java
@Component
public class SomeExternalService {
	//external.service.url, from app.properties
	@Value("${external.service.url}")
	private String url;
	
	public String returnServiceURL() {
		return url;
	}
}

com.jerryc.spring.basics.springin5steps.SpringIn5StepsPropertiesApplication.java
@Configuration
@ComponentScan
@PropertySource("classpath:app.properties")
public class SpringIn5StepsPropertiesApplication {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		try (AnnotationConfigApplicationContext applicationContext =
			new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(SpringIn5StepsPropertiesApplication.class)) {
		
			SomeExternalService someExternalService = applicationContext.getBean(SomeExternalService.class);
			System.out.println(someExternalService.returnServiceURL());

		}
	}
}

_____________________Spring Level 3 - Unit Testing with Spring Framework____________________
-------------Spring Unit Testing with Java Context
// 36. JUnit in 5 Steps 

// 37. Step 1 : What is JUnit and Unit Testing?
Unit Testing - Testing a specific method or class
JUnit - Frameword for doing unit testing
Once you write the JUnit test, then it is automated (you can run it again and again) -- Continuous Integration

// 38. Step 2 : First JUnit Project and Green Bar
Create /test fold separate from src/ folder
@Test  - Annotation for a JUnit Test
Absence is failure is Success
// 39. Step 3 : First Code and First Unit Test
// 40. Step 4 : Other assert methods
// 41. Step 5 : Important annotations
**** The Above Spring JUnit Testing with Java Context was LAME compard to other JUnit tutorials that I have taken *****

-------------Spring Unit Testing with Mockito
Seciton: Using Mockito Annotations - @Mock, @InjectMocks, @RunWith
/mockito-unit-testing/src/test/java/com/jerryc/spring/mockito/mockitounittesting/SomeBussinessMockAnnotationTest.java
***** FAILED when I tried to run tests *****
FIX WITH - TestingWTF_FIX
SUSPECTED PROBLEM: <------------------************************* == TestingWTF
- Instructor using JUnit 4 and Mockito
- I'm using JUnit Jupiter/JUniit 5 and Mockito
DETERMINED FIX:  <-----------------------************************* == TestingWTF_FIX
- I Added JUnit 5 Library to project
- Added dependency:
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-test</artifactId>
			<version>5.2.5.RELEASE</version>
		</dependency>
--> Which added spring-test-5.2.5.RELEASE.jar 
> org.springframework.test.context.junit.jupiter
>> SpringExtension.class
I determined and used:
@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class)
@ContextConfiguration(classes= {SpringIn5StepsBasicApplication.class})
public class BinarySearchTest {		
Instead of:
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@ContextConfiguration(classes= {SpringIn5StepsBasicApplication.class})
public class BinarySearchTest {
DETERMINED FIX:  <-----------------------************************* == TestingWTF_FIX

-------------Spring Unit Testing in my project spring-in-5-steps (https://github.com/jerry-carney/spring-in-5-minutes)
TestingWTF_FIX
- Instructor removed current spring test dependency and added a few more, result: Errors all through the project

- I commented out the added dependencies and remained with the current spring test dependency == NO CHANGE
Step 27 - Spring Unit Testing with a Java Context
@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class)
@ContextConfiguration(classes= {SpringIn5StepsBasicApplication.class})
public class BinarySearchTest {	
- TestingWTF_FIX - I used this instead of what the instructor was using


Step 28 - Spring Unit Testing with an XML Context
@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class)
@ContextConfiguration(locations="/applicationContext.xml")
public class BinarySearchXmlConfigurationTest {

Step 29 - Spring Unit Testing with Mockito
	@Mock
	SomeCdiDao daoMock;
	
	@InjectMocks
	SomeCdiBusiness businessMock;
	
	@Test  // Mock Test
	public void testMockScenario() {
		when(daoMock.getData()).thenReturn(new int[] {24, 15, 3});
		assertEquals(24, businessMock.findTheGreatestFromAllData());
	}
